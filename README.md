# [98-MoGallery](https://github.com/molab-itp/98-MoGallery)

MoGallery is a mobile app for students to quickly create their own mobile multi user experiences. It builds on the Apple SwiftUI tutorial that demonstrates access to the iOS Photo library and adds Google Firebase for multi user cloud storage features.

MoGallery is an iOS mobile template app for students to build on these features:

- Capture photos to store on device Photo Library or in user defined galleries in Firebase cloud storage.
- Share and Manage photo galleries with Firebase realtime database.
- Secure User login management with Google signin.
- Share photos beyond the app using web browser

p5js demo scripts to view Firebase storage in any web browser

Created for NYU ITP Course:

- [ITP Mobile App Development Lab course](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2023-fa)

## Requirements

- iPhone/iPad running iOS 16+, to run the app
- macOS 13+, for Xcode development

## Manifesto

Born of a need to share and collaborate free of evil profit-driven corporations.

## Plan-Issues:

[] MediaDetailView showInfoOverlay locationDescription 
    location not show on in Map tab
    
[] LimitedPicker nav view stays up after selection

[] earlier photo progress view needed for add random

[] Thread Performance Checker: Thread running at User-initiated quality-of-service 
    class waiting on a thread without a QoS class specified (base priority 33). 
    Investigate ways to avoid priority inversions

2022-12-17 JHT: Truely bizarre -
this code is extracted from
https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/capturingphotos-browsephotos
which is download as CapturingPhotos.swiftpm
which can be openned in xcode or swift playground app.
link [View a tutorial on this sample.] appears to only make sense in swift playground
I added [tutorial] which opens useless xcode browser link preview

>> example has deep logic that is only skimmed over in tutorial
>> needed to add Info.plist in xcode to allow for camera and photo library access
>> not sure how to do this via "Signing & Capabilities"

Below is the description of the original Apple tutorial used as a starting point for the app:

# Browsing Your Photos

Browse the photos in your photo library.

## Overview

Enjoy taking photos? Most of us do, and it‚Äôs easy to end up with hundreds or thousands of photos in your library. üèû

Follow your photos as they‚Äôre retrieved from your photo library and displayed in a scrolling gallery you can browse.
